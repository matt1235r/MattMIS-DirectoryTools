      <h2>MattMIS Sync</h2>
<p>MattMIS Sync is a simple program designed to keep your organisations Active Directory records in sync with your MIS. <strong>(namely SIMS.net)</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike some other projects, MattMIS Sync is designed to complement your existing Active Directory solution rather than be a complete replacement. You can use as many or as few features as you like: <em>you could simply just use the project to handle name changes for example.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Disclaimer: This program was developed for a specific environment – use at your own risk! If you do wish to use this project, thorough testing and adaption for your environment is required.</b></em></p>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creates accounts for all new students and staff, with lots of configuration options such as AD groups, OU locations, naming conventions etc.</li>
